         <p>Kearney (pronounced Kar-nee) is one of the best places to see the Sandhill Crane Migration spectacle. Eighty percent of the world’s population (that’s over half a million birds) spend about six weeks in the area of Nebraska’s Platte River. During the day, the cranes fatten up on waste corn in the fields before continuing their migration north. At night, they roost in the Platte River, protected from predators. The Rowe Sanctuary’s enormous hide provides an ideal location for watching the birds at sunrise and sunset.</p>
